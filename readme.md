## Running Mineral House Spa locally
Mineral House Spa is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line:
```
https://github.com/gii-is-DP1/dp1-2020-g2-07.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
```
You can then access Mineral House Spa here: http://localhost:80/


Or you can run it from Maven directly using the Spring Boot Maven plugin. If you do this it will pick up changes that you make in the project immediately (changes to Java source files require a compile as well - most people use an IDE for this):
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
## Database configuration
In its default configuration, Mineral House Spa uses an in-memory database (H2) which gets populated at startup with data.
